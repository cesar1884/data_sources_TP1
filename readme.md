## Getting Started

This section covers the basics of setting up a small Python application using Flask. To get started:

1. Install Flask with `pip install Flask`.
2. Create a new Flask app by defining routes and rendering templates.

## Versioning with GitHub

To ensure our code remains organized and to facilitate collaboration, the codebase is versioned using GitHub:

1. Initialize a new Git repository in the project directory using `git init`.
2. Create a new repository on GitHub.
3. Link our local repository to the GitHub repository and push our initial commit.

## Deployment on Deta

To make our application available online, we used Deta for deployment:

1. Install the Deta CLI tool.
2. Set up a new Deta project and link it to our application.
3. Deploy the application using the Deta CLI.

## Tracking with Google Analytics

To understand user behavior and gather insights on application usage, Google Analytics was integrated:

1. Sign up for a Google Analytics account and set up a new property for the application.
2. Integrate the Google Analytics tracking code into our Flask application.
3. Monitor real-time and historical data on user interactions and behaviors through the Google Analytics dashboard.
